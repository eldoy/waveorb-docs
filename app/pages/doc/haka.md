## Haka front end toolkit

Haka is our [functional Javascript HTML and DOM manipulation toolkit.](https://github.com/eldoy/haka) The whole library is only about 3K minified and is very light weight and fast. It is included by default in the default Waveorb app.

The script loads several functions into the window object to make them available everywhere.

[Read about how to use Haka here.](https://github.com/eldoy/haka#readme)
