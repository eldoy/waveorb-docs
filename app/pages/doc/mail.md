## Mail

For sending mail we made the [wmail](https://github.com/eldoy/wmail) library, which uses [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) to deliver emails. You can set up any email sending library with [plugins](/doc/plugins) if you don't want to use this one.

Check out [the documentation for wmail](https://github.com/eldoy/wmail#readme) to set up your emails.

Happy sending!
